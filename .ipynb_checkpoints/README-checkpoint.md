## Initial Reseach

Researched matplotlib source documentation [1]. Thought about what type of cisuals I could put onto plots and how to visualise the data. 
Also thought about how to best describe the package. 


## How to run the notebook


1. Download [Anaconda]().
2. Download [cmdr]() if on Windows.
3. Run 'jupyter lab'.
